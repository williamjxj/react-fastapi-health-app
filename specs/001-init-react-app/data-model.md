# Data Model: Initialize React Application

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Feature**: Initialize React Application

## Overview

This feature is a project initialization task and does not involve data entities, database schemas, or data persistence. The initialization creates a frontend-only React application structure with configuration files and project scaffolding.

## Not Applicable

This feature does not define:
- Database entities
- Data models
- API data structures
- State management data models
- Data validation rules

The initialized project will be ready to accept data models and entities as features are developed on top of this foundation.

## Configuration Files

While not data entities, the following configuration files are created during initialization:

- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite build tool configuration
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind CSS configuration
- `eslint.config.js`: ESLint code quality rules
- `prettier.config.js`: Prettier formatting rules
- `vitest.config.ts`: Vitest testing configuration
- `components.json`: shadcn/ui component configuration

These configuration files define the project's technical setup but do not represent domain data models.
