# API Contracts: Initialize React Application

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Feature**: Initialize React Application

## Overview

This feature is a project initialization task and does not involve API endpoints, REST services, or external API integrations. The initialization creates a frontend-only React application structure.

## Not Applicable

This feature does not define:
- REST API endpoints
- GraphQL schemas
- WebSocket connections
- External service integrations
- API request/response contracts

The initialized project will be ready to accept API contracts and integrations as features are developed on top of this foundation.

## Future API Integration

When features requiring API integration are developed, contracts should be added to this directory following standard patterns:
- REST APIs: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- GraphQL: Schema definitions
- WebSocket: Protocol definitions
- gRPC: Protocol buffer definitions
